## Guide to playing maps with this mod
this mod is not really meant to be for the campain because it takes too long to research,unlock,and progress with this mod in a short time,however,to start a playthrough with this here is what you do (if you have copper instead of seed as starting materal,if thats the case,ignore the first part

1.) When you spawn in,get 100 copper and build a Tree grower (Copper) to start getting seeds [I] 

2.) Using the seeds,Either build a Tree grower (Seeded,because its faster) or a Tree,to get Logs [I] 

3.) as of right now you have to pick up the logs and put them in your base manually,to prevent this,build a Road (Starter conveyor),they only cost 1 log,connect this roadway to your base [I] 

4.) after getting a good amount of logs and seeds,start trying to produce planks by building a sawmill,1 log is 3 planks [I] 

thats it for the guide,you now know what to do next (prepare defenses,build a factory,etc),if you want some certain info look at the descriptions of the blocks and items,they can probably guide you on what to do next
